# HotMesh Dashboard
The HotMesh React Dashboard (available on request) provides a visual surface for the HotMesh Pluck SDK. It aids in monitoring running workflows, executing aggregation queries and managing the distributed Service Mesh of connected functions.

The RESTful endpoints (`/api/v1/users` and `/api/v1/bills`) provide familiar entry points for managing entities (User and Bill), while the Pluck RPC route (`/api/v1/pluck`) provides an RPC-like interface for conrolling pluck from the Dashboard Web UI.

Use the provided [postman](../postman/) collections to interact with the API endpoints and the Pluck RPC route.
